				I was looking for a professional to help create a website to sell my paintings.
				I tried calling multiple people and everyone was either busy or was out of my budget.
				I wanted someone that could communicate with me openely and would work with my budget
				so, I tried ASU Student Solutions. Within a few minutes of signing up and
				searching for what services I needed, I was provided a list of
				web developers in my area and their ratings. I chose one and within a matter of
				one evening I received a call from him and in no time we were at work! I
				am extremely happy with his work and will call him with more work anytime
				it's needed. I highly recommend using ASU Student Solutions if you are
				starting a business!

		I am an avid entrepreneur and found ASU Student Solutions website easy 
		to use! Once I and my partner created our vision for Entertainment 720, 
		we knew we had to put our plan in motion. Within a few days I had 
		meetings with a graphic designers, web developers, software developers, 
		marketing specialist and a professional accountant. We had a wonderful 
		experience with them all and have created a lasting professional 
		relationships. Our accountant Ben was thorough and helped with our 
		budgeting. Thank you, ASU Student Solutions!

		I have also found the website to be extremely easy to use! 
	  I am a realtor so having a website is a huge must! I am so 
		glad I used ASU Student Solutions to find a website 
		developer as well as a professional photographer. Great 
		prices and professionalism from both people!
